# Installation

## Recommended: Homebridge UI
1. Install [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge): see the [Homebridge wiki](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki)
2. In the Homebridge Web-GUI, search for the "Tesla Powerwall" plugin and install it.
3. Configure the plugin using the config UI interface.

## Command Line Installation
```bash
npm install -g homebridge-tesla-powerwall
```

## Testing Your Connection

Before configuring the plugin, test your connection to ensure everything works:

```bash
# Navigate to the plugin directory (if installed globally)
cd $(npm root -g)/homebridge-tesla-powerwall

# Run the connection test
node test/integration/test-connection.js <ip-address> <username> <password>

# Example:
node test/integration/test-connection.js 192.168.1.50 customer your-password-here
```

The test script will:
- ✅ Verify authentication
- ✅ Test battery status retrieval
- ✅ Test power flow data
- ✅ Test grid connectivity status
- 📋 Provide configuration template for Homebridge

## Features

### Accessories Provided

1. **Battery Status** - Shows battery charge level, charging state, and low battery alerts
2. **Grid Status Sensor** - Contact sensor that shows if the grid is connected or disconnected
3. **Grid Feeding Sensor** ⭐ **NEW** - Contact sensor that triggers when power is being fed to the grid (export)
4. **Grid Pulling Sensor** ⭐ **NEW** - Contact sensor that triggers when power is being pulled from the grid (import)
5. **Power Meters** - Light sensors showing power flow for Solar, Grid, and Load

### Grid Power Sensors - Automation Examples ⭐ **NEW**

The new grid power sensors enable powerful HomeKit automations:

#### Example 1: Get notified when exporting power to the grid
```
When: Grid Feeding Sensor detects contact
Then: Send notification "You're selling power to the grid! 💰"
```

#### Example 2: Notify when importing expensive peak power
```
When: Grid Pulling Sensor detects contact
AND Time is between 4:00 PM and 9:00 PM
Then: Send notification "Using peak power from grid ⚡"
```

#### Example 3: Turn off non-essential loads when pulling from grid
```
When: Grid Pulling Sensor detects contact
Then: 
  - Turn off pool pump
  - Turn off EV charger
  - Send notification "Reducing load to minimize grid usage"
```

#### Example 4: Start charging devices when exporting to grid
```
When: Grid Feeding Sensor detects contact
AND Battery level > 80%
Then: 
  - Start EV charging
  - Turn on pool pump
  - Send notification "Free solar power available! ☀️"
```

### Sensor Threshold Configuration

The `gridSensorThreshold` setting (default 50W) prevents false triggers from minor power fluctuations:
- **50W (default)**: Good balance for most installations
- **100W+**: Recommended for systems with frequent small fluctuations
- **0W**: Maximum sensitivity, may cause false triggers

## Legacy Configuration (from v3.x)

For users upgrading from version 3.x, the plugin has been simplified. The old `additionalServices` configuration is no longer needed. Simply use the new boolean flags:
- `enableGridStatus` - replaces gridstatus options
- `enableGridPowerSensors` - NEW feature for grid power flow detection
- `enablePowerMeters` - replaces individual meter options
- `enableHistory` - replaces eveHistory options

## API Limitations

### Operation Mode Control (Issue #54)

**Important Note**: Due to recent Tesla Powerwall firmware updates, **operation mode control (switching between Self-Powered, Time-based, or changing Backup Reserve) is NOT available via the local API**. 

According to Tesla's architecture:
- The **local API** (used by this plugin) provides read-only access to system status and power flow data
- **Operation mode changes** require the Tesla Fleet API, which needs cloud authentication

If you need to automate operation mode changes, you have these options:
1. Use the Tesla mobile app manually
2. Integrate with Tesla's Fleet API (requires developer account and cloud access)
3. Use a separate automation system that supports the Tesla Fleet API

This plugin focuses on what's possible with the local API:
- Real-time monitoring of battery, grid, solar, and load
- Grid power flow detection (feeding/pulling sensors)
- Grid connectivity status
- Triggering HomeKit automations based on power flow

We may add Tesla Fleet API support in a future version if there's sufficient demand and if it can be implemented without compromising security or requiring complex cloud setups.

## Example Configurations

### Minimal Configuration
```json
{
    "platform": "TeslaPowerwall",
    "name": "Tesla Powerwall",
    "ip": "192.168.1.50",
    "password": "your-password-here",
    "pollingInterval": 10
}
```

### Full Configuration with All Features

{
    "platform": "TeslaPowerwall",
    "name": "Tesla Powerwall",
    "ip": "192.168.1.50",
    "password": "your-password-here",
    "pollingInterval": 15,
    "enableGridStatus": true,
    "enableGridPowerSensors": true,
    "gridSensorThreshold": 50,
    "enablePowerMeters": true,
    "enableHistory": false,
    "debug": false
}
```

### Configuration with Disabled Sensors
```json
{
    "platform": "TeslaPowerwall",
    "name": "Tesla Powerwall",
    "ip": "192.168.1.50",
    "password": "your-password-here",
    "pollingInterval": 15,
    "enableGridStatus": false,
    "enableGridPowerSensors": false,

}
```

## Troubleshooting

### 🔧 Connection Testing

Always start with the connection test script:
```bash
node test/integration/test-connection.js <ip> <username> <password>
```

### ❌ Login Errors

If you get login errors (403, authentication failed):
1. Verify your password is correct
2. Ensure username is "customer" (currently the only supported value)
3. Check if your Powerwall requires re-registration
4. Try the connection test script for detailed debugging

### 🔄 Plugin Stopped Working After Powerwall Update

- Ensure you're using the latest plugin version (4.1.0+)
- Verify the `password` field is correctly configured
- The `username` should be "customer"

### ⚡ Grid Power Sensors Not Triggering

If the new grid power sensors aren't working as expected:
1. Check the `gridSensorThreshold` setting - you may need to adjust it
2. Use debug logging to see actual power values: `"debug": true`
3. Verify your Powerwall is actually feeding/pulling power above the threshold
4. Check the Homebridge logs for sensor state changes

### 📊 For Older Powerwall Versions (< 20.49.0)

If your Powerwall firmware is older than 20.49.0, you may need to use the legacy version:
```bash
npm install -g homebridge-tesla-powerwall@1.1.0
```

## Development

### Building from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nmuldoon/homebridge-tesla-powerwall.git
cd homebridge-tesla-powerwall
npm install
npm run build
```

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test
npm run lint
```

## Migration from v3.x to v4.1.0

The v4.x updates include major improvements:

1. **Node.js Requirement**: Now requires Node.js 18.15.0+
2. **Simplified Configuration**: The complex `additionalServices` object has been simplified to simple boolean flags
3. **New Features**: Grid power sensors for automation triggers
4. **Dependencies**: All dependencies updated to latest versions
5. **Testing**: Use the new test script to verify connectivity

### Breaking Changes from v3.x
- Configuration format has been simplified (old format still works but is deprecated)
- Some advanced Eve features may not be available in v4.x

Simply update the plugin and restart Homebridge. Your existing configuration should continue to work, but consider migrating to the new simpler format.
